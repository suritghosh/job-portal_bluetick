# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Home.js:
In this section, the core functionality of the job board application is established. A functional component named Home is defined, serving as the main interface. The utilization of the useState hook is noteworthy, as it facilitates the management of the count for visible jobs through the visibleJobs state. This count is utilized to regulate the display of job listings. The "Load more jobs" button, when interacted with, triggers the loadMoreJobs function, leading to an update in the visibleJobs state, thereby expanding the list of jobs presented to the user.

### Jobs.js:
Contained within this section is a crucial component responsible for the presentation of job listings. Similar to the preceding code, the useState hook is employed, but this instance pertains to the jobs array. This array accommodates the job data fetched from the Hacker News API. The pivotal aspect of this component lies within the useEffect hook. Here, the intention is evident â€“ whenever there is an alteration in the count of visible jobs (indicated by the props.visibleJobs variable), the component triggers an API request to retrieve an updated selection of job data.

### Nav.js:
The element of navigation within the application is encapsulated in this segment. Within the Nav component, the presentation of the logo and search bar is meticulously structured. Notably, CSS stylings are thoughtfully employed to ensure the responsiveness of the search bar across varying screen dimensions. Moreover, an array of icons, each representing distinct sections, is integrated within the interface, contributing to a comprehensive user experience.
